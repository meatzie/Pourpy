# Pourpy

Pourpy is a silly project aiming to become a useful brewing recipe and batch tracking tool.

A good enough excuse as any to get our hands dirty in python/django/data analysis with the lovely reward of washing it down with home brewed mead/wine/whatever. 

Someday it will be populated with dashboards, recipe books, and data collection of live fermentation. Maybe it will even work!
